 * This exists because jsdom performs no layout, so the 341 unit tests cannot
 * see an overflow at all: that is how #84 survived a measurement pass. It also
 * exists because #85 took four manual attempts to measure, and three of them
 * came back clean while measuring the wrong thing. Those three are the reason

/* 320 is §8.5's bar. 305 is what a 320px window actually gives the page once a
   classic scrollbar takes its 15px of layout width — the condition #85 names,
   and the reason a sweep at 320 alone is not enough. 407 is the last width
   below `spacing.css`'s `min-width: 408px`, so it pins the narrow rack tier's
   upper edge; a regression that only appears one pixel under the breakpoint has
   somewhere to be caught. 408 is the first width above it, and the middle
   tier's tightest: overhang is largest where content is smallest within a tier,
   and until #130 no sweep had ever run on that side of the boundary at all.

   Layout cannot tell why it has a given content width, only what it is — but a
   MEDIA QUERY can, and that is where the equivalence breaks. `spacing.css`
   matches the scrollbar-INCLUSIVE viewport while every reading below is taken
   against the content box, so which tier answers a given content width depends
   on whether the platform draws a scrollbar that takes layout width. The tier
   is therefore derived from the outer box and asserted, never assumed: a sweep
   that comes back clean having measured the wrong tier is the exact shape of
   the three #85 attempts that reported `clean` and counted for nothing. */

 *
 * 305 is the content width a 320px window gives the page once a classic
 * scrollbar takes its 15px, and the narrow tier still fires there, so this
