/* An `animation:` naming a keyframe no stylesheet defines fails silently — no
   error, no warning, no motion (journal-2026-08-09). Nothing catches it at
   build time, nothing catches it in review, and a rendering test cannot see it
   either, because jsdom performs no layout. So the whole class is caught here
   instead: read the sources, and require that every keyframe src/ animates is
   one keyframes.css defines.
   This reads files rather than rendering, so it is also the one motion check
   jsdom's missing layout does not compromise. It guards renames as much as
   typos — rename a keyframe out from under a consumer and this goes red. */
